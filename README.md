There is no specific task or aim at this notebook. 
There is a train reviews dataset and I try to explore it in depth and figure out what the reviews are mostly about. 

What this notebook consists of: 
1. Data read/basic cleaning
2. Data preprocessing (columns analysis, text cleaning, feature engineering)
3. Exploratory Data Analysis to find underline patters
4. Topic Extraction - Latent Dirichlet Allocation
5. Topics processing and engineering
6. Topics validation #1 Non negative matrix factorization
7. Topics validation #2 Kmeans for clustering
